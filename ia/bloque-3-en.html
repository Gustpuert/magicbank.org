<h1>Official Guide to Using MagicBank</h1>
<h2>How to enter, learn, and make the most of the platform</h2>

<p>Before explaining how to learn with MagicBank, it is essential to understand a basic and non-negotiable requirement: to use MagicBank — even for a guided tour — you must have an active ChatGPT session.</p>

<p>This requirement is not technical by whim. It is structural. MagicBank is not an isolated platform. It is a system that is powered by ChatGPT and, at the same time, enhances ChatGPT through an advanced educational layer.</p>

<h3>Why an active ChatGPT session is mandatory</h3>

<p>MagicBank uses ChatGPT to run its tutors, maintain contextual memory, respond in real time, and adapt instruction to each user.</p>

<p>At the same time, MagicBank enhances ChatGPT through advanced instructions, behavioral prompts, thematic specialization, integration of books and academic knowledge, and proprietary pedagogical models.</p>

<p>If you do not have an active ChatGPT session, informational tutors will not function, guided tours will not display correctly, and demonstrative or final tutors cannot be activated.</p>

<h3>What MagicBank is and how it is organized</h3>

<p>MagicBank is an educational platform with artificial intelligence instructors designed to surpass the traditional model of generic teachers, recorded courses, and static content.</p>

<p>It does not replicate the classic educational model. It transforms it through specialized tutors, guided instruction, and adaptation to the learner’s real pace.</p>

<h3>MagicBank University</h3>

<p>MagicBank University is organized by faculties, each with highly specialized tutors. Some of the available faculties include Law, Accounting, Business Administration, Marketing, and Software Development.</p>

<p>Each university tutor teaches a single discipline, maintains thematic coherence, stays constantly updated, and applies high academic rigor.</p>

<h3>MagicBank Academy</h3>

<p>MagicBank Academy offers practical and applied training. It includes areas such as cooking and gastronomy, intelligent nutrition, and language learning, including English, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, and Mandarin Chinese.</p>

<p>Language tutors teach patiently, correct pronunciation, and accompany users in real contexts such as travel, conferences, and everyday conversations.</p>

<h3>Arts and Trades</h3>

<p>MagicBank includes training factories designed to teach complete trades, such as ice cream production, international cocktails, desserts, hot and cold beverages, and pizza making.</p>

<p>Each factory allows learning for enjoyment or entrepreneurship, using tutors optimized for real-world processes.</p>

<h3>Introduction to the Tutor Factory</h3>

<p>MagicBank includes a Tutor Factory dedicated to creating artificial intelligence assistants specialized for real professional and human contexts. This is where the Professional Assistant Tutors (TAP) and MagicBank Supertutors are developed.</p>

<p>The next block explains how to interact correctly with these tutors and how to make the most of the learning experience.</p>
