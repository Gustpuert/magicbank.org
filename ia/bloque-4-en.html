<h1>User Experience and Best Practices</h1>
<h2>How to use MagicBank correctly and efficiently</h2>

<h3>How the guided tour works</h3>

<p>MagicBank allows users to explore the platform through a guided tour. The purpose of this tour is not to sell, but to show how the experience with artificial intelligence tutors actually works.</p>

<p>During the guided tour, users can interact with demonstration tutors, ask up to three questions per tutor, and explore different teaching styles before making a decision.</p>

<h3>Support channels and contact</h3>

<p>If users have questions before, during, or after their training, they can use the Informational Tutor, write to magicbankia@gmail.com, or contact WhatsApp at +57 311 271 1772.</p>

<h3>What a chat is and why it matters</h3>

<p>A chat is not just a conversation. It is a contextual memory space where the tutor understands the topic, recognizes the user’s level, remembers progress, and maintains the learning objective.</p>

<p>When chat boundaries are respected, the tutor maintains coherence, precision, and depth.</p>

<h3>What happens when a chat becomes saturated</h3>

<p>A chat becomes saturated when too many topics are mixed or when learning continuity is broken. When this happens, the tutor may lose precision, mix concepts, or drift away from the original objective.</p>

<h3>How to recognize when the tutor has lost coherence</h3>

<p>Clear signs include incorrect responses, contradictions, topic mixing, or loss of process continuity. This does not mean the tutor is bad, but that the context has been damaged.</p>

<h3>How to restore tutor coherence</h3>

<p>When this occurs, the correct procedure is to stop that chat, open a new one, briefly explain where you were, and continue with a single topic. This restores clarity and precision.</p>

<h3>The MagicBank golden rule</h3>

<p>One topic per chat. One module equals one chat. Separate questions require separate chats. Order protects the tutor’s accuracy.</p>

<h3>When to use voice and when not to use it</h3>

<p>Voice is the most expensive resource in artificial intelligence and, for that reason, it comes with time limits for all users. It is not recommended to use voice for trivial conversations or to ask the tutor to read aloud texts that can be easily read.</p>

<p>Written text is more precise, more stable, and goes directly to the point. Voice, by nature, tends to summarize and economize information due to the technical costs involved.</p>

<p>Proper voice usage should be reserved for specific cases where it truly adds value.</p>

<p>A clear example is language learning. In this case, voice should be used primarily for pronunciation and phonetic correction.</p>

<p>The tutor can show written pronunciation and then pronounce it aloud. For example:</p>

<p><em>What is your name?</em><br>
Not “name”, but <strong>“neim”</strong>.<br>
<em>What is your neim?</em></p>

<p><em>Where are you from?</em><br>
<em>Wer ar yu from?</em></p>

<p>The learner can copy these phrases, practice for five minutes a day or once a week, listen to the tutor, and then repeat so the tutor can correct pronunciation.</p>

<p>This conscious use makes the voice tutor experience truly useful and enriching.</p>

<p>Using voice to read long content that can be read in text means spending limited voice time on something unnecessary. This document serves as a clear record that voice interaction is limited and must be used efficiently.</p>

<h3>Why these rules improve the experience</h3>

<p>When users follow these best practices, the experience is smoother, learning is deeper, and artificial intelligence maintains its highest quality.</p>

<p>MagicBank does not improvise. MagicBank educates with method.</p>
